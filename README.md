# prices

Micro data on prices in the UK. For more detailed discussion, charts, papers, etc, please see my web site:  www.richarddavies.io

November 2019 update. The file now has 40m prices, covering 1988-2019. In terms of the files I have pushed here:

(1) Prices_5pct.  This is a 5% sample of the prices.  (I recommend running all code on this, and switching to fuller files only when things work)

(2) Percentiles.  This is the deciles of the prices for all the goods from p10 to p90. This should be useful to people thinking about distributions. 

(3) Lightbulbs. This is all the data for one good - lightbulbs - again this is a good training file, as the other products sampled will be akin to this. 

(4) Item. This file decodes the item variable in the main file. 

(5) Date. This file decodes the date variable in the main file. I am also adding macro variables that I am using to this file. 

If anyone finds their way here and would like the full file I am happy to share.
